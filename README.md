## Michelle Boula | Data Analyst | Cannabis Compliance & Systems Strategy
Welcome to my digital greenhouse — where analytics meets advocacy, and dashboards grow from lived experience.

### 💾 A Digital Life Rooted in the Old Internet

I didn’t pivot into tech. I grew up in it.

While other kids were learning how to log on, I was already deep in the command line — organizing folders and launching Doom mods from MS-DOS to help my dad run his business.
It wasn’t fancy — just floppy disks and black screens — but it felt like freedom.
The keyboard was my map, and I loved the feeling of getting somewhere with just a few typed words.

That wasn’t just a game — it was my first exposure to flags, scripts, hardware logic, and computational cause-and-effect. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was building the same technical muscles I’d later use for data modeling, system diagnostics, and structured analytics.

Before Myspace, I was deep in Color Your Profile — tweaking early HTML, embedding glitter GIFs, timing ASCII loaders to match AIM status updates. I learned to speak identity through code.

### 🌿 A Mind Wired for Systems (and Cannabis)

From underground grows in NY (disguised in tomato gardens — yes, really), to hand-crafting Rick Simpson Oil for my son and grandmother, I’ve always followed **pattern, outcome, and root cause**.

- How sunlight stress affects terpene expression 🌞  
- Why cross-pollination flips gender in cultivars 🐝  
- What strain data says about executive function under burnout 🔍

I’m not here for “cannabis industry trends.”  
I’m here to **build intelligence systems** for it.

### 🔍 Now I Analyze Everything

From HUD housing enforcement patterns in Texas to multi-state THC:CBD ratio mapping, I use:
- **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Google Sheets**  
- **Pattern recognition & compliance workflow audits**  
- **Cannabis regulation logic, from molecule to statute**

My Substack ["Boula’s Bud Bar"](https://boulasbudbar.substack.com) blends **data dashboards** with **strain reviews**, **compliance analysis**, and the **occasional terpene-themed rant**. You’ve been warned (and invited).

<h2>🛠️ Tools That Inspire This Work</h2>
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://www.cannlytics.com/" target="_blank">Cannlytics</a></strong> — Built by Keegan Skeate, Cannlytics is an open-source cannabis analytics suite for COA parsing, terpene modeling, and compliance tracking.
  <br>
  His mission to make cannabis data transparent and accessible shaped how I think about public tools, and sparked many of the dashboards and questions I explore here.

✨ I don’t just do data — I debug the system. And I don’t just “know cannabis” — I live it, study it, and design **decision tools** from it. Let’s build something green and grounded.
