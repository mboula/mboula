## Michelle Boula | Data Analyst • Systems Thinker • Cannabis & Civil Rights Tech

Welcome to my digital greenhouse — where analytics meets advocacy, and dashboards grow from lived experience.

### 💾 A Digital Life Rooted in the Old Internet

I didn’t pivot into tech. I grew up in it.

Before I turned 9, I was organizing file systems and launching custom Doom mods from the MS-DOS prompt — all while helping my dad run his business. For me, the command line wasn’t intimidating; it was home.

That wasn’t just a game — it was my first exposure to flags, scripts, hardware logic, and computational cause-and-effect. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was building the same technical muscles I’d later use for **data modeling, system diagnostics, and structured analytics**.

While others were customizing MySpace, I was deep in **Color Your Profile** — tweaking early HTML, embedding glitter GIFs, timing ASCII loaders to match AIM status updates. I learned to speak identity through code.

### 🌿 A Mind Wired for Systems (and Cannabis)

From underground grows in NY (disguised in tomato gardens — yes, really), to hand-crafting Rick Simpson Oil for my son and grandmother, I’ve always followed **pattern, outcome, and root cause**.

- How sunlight stress affects terpene expression 🌞  
- Why cross-pollination flips gender in cultivars 🐝  
- What strain data says about executive function under burnout 🔍

I’m not here for “cannabis industry trends.”  
I’m here to **build intelligence systems** for it.

### 🔍 Now I Analyze Everything

From HUD housing enforcement patterns in Texas to multi-state THC:CBD ratio mapping, I use:
- **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Google Sheets**  
- **Pattern recognition & compliance workflow audits**  
- **Cannabis regulation logic, from molecule to statute**

My Substack ["Boula’s Bud Bar"](https://boulasbudbar.substack.com) blends **data dashboards** with **strain reviews**, **compliance analysis**, and the **occasional terpene-themed rant**. You’ve been warned (and invited).

✨ I don’t just do data — I debug the system. And I don’t just “know cannabis” — I live it, study it, and design **decision tools** from it. Let’s build something green and grounded.
